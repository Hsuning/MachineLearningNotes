#Clustering #Unsupervised 

```toc

### Concept
- Given a dataset without label, it automatically group data points that are related or similar based on their features

### Goal
Find patterns or particular type of structures and see if it can be grouped into classes, without prior knowledge of the groups or categories that the data may naturally belong to.

### How it works
- analyzing the distance or similarity between data points
- assigning them to clusters based on these measurements
- hierarchical clustering, k-means and density based clustering

### Application
- grouping similar news
- market segmentation
- DNA (genetic expression data)
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Astronomical data analysis: group bodies in space together, figure out which ones form one galaxy or coherent structures in space

## Random Sampling and Sample Bias
- Sample : subset of data from a larger data set
- Population: the larger data set or idea of a data set
- N : the size of the population
- Random sampling: equal chance of being chosen for the same at each draw
	- with or without replacement
	- reduce bias and facilitate quality improvement
- Stratified sampling: dividing the population into strata and randomly sampling from each strata
- Bias: systematic error, measurement or sampling process that are produced by the measurement or sampling process
	- random chance
	- Bias occurs when measurements or observations are systematically in error because they are not representative of the full population
- Sample bias: a sample that misrepresents the populations

## Size of data
- Sometimes smaller is better
	- missing data and outliers may contain useful information, can be done with a sample
- This is a true big data problemâ€”only when such enormous quantities of data are accumulated can effective search results be returned for most queries. And the more data accumulates, the better the results


## Selection Bias
 - Selection bias: Bias resulting from the way in which observations are selected.
 - Data snooping: Extensive hunting through data in search of something interesting.
 - Vast search effect: Bias or non-reproducibility resulting from repeated data modelling, or modelling data with large numbers of predictor variables.

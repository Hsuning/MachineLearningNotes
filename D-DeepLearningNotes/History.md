# Neural networks / Deep Learning
- Algorithms that try to mimic the brain
- Used in the 1980's and early 1990's. Then fell out of favor
- Resurgence from around 2005
- Used in everything: Speech, Computer Vision, NLP, Climate Change, Medical Imaging, Online Advertising, Product Recommendation

Neurons in the brain
- Input : receive electrical impulses from other neurons, aggregate them
- output: sending electrical impulses / forming new connections
- We still have no idea on how the human brain works, every few years, neuroscientists make some fundamental breakthrough about how the brain works

Simplified mathematical model of a neuron. However, we only use engineering principles to figure out how to build algorithms .

Why now?
- Digitalisation of the society: the amount of digital data has exploded
- Faster computer processors, GPUs
- Example of amount of data vs performance of algorithms
	- Large NN > Medium NN > Small MM > Traditional AI

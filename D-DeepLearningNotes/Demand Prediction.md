If a t-shirt will be a top selling.

Data with price and top seller or not
goals: inventory level, marketing campaign

Input
x = price of t=shirt

Output
$a=f(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(wx+b)}}$
$a$ = activation, how much a neuron is sending a high output to other neurons 
logistic model can be a simple neuron

Neuron : tiny little computer, the only job is to input one number or a few numbers, and output one/a few other numbers = probability of being top seller

Neuron Network is an oversimplified model of the human brain 



layer can have N neurons or 1 layer
output layer: the output of this final neuron is the output probability predicted by the neural network

Activations: degree that the biological neuron is sending a high output value or sending many electrical impulses to other neurons to the downstream from it

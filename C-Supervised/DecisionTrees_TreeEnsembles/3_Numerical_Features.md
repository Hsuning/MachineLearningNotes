How #DecisionTree split on continuous valued features

- Split based on if the weight is less than or equal to some value, e.g. Weights < 8lbs
- Learning algorithm will automatically pick the one that gives the best information gain
- Consider different values to split on => carry out the usual information gain calculation => decide to split on that continuous value feature if it gives the highest possible information gain

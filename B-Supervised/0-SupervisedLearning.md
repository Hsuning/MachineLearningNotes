#Supervised 
##### Learn from being given "right answers"

The goal of supervised learning is, given a training set, to learn a function $h:X -> y$ so that h(x) is a good predictor for the corresponding value of y.

By seeing correct pairs of input x and desired output label y, learns to take just the input alone without the output label and gives a resonably accurate prediction of the output.

#### Use cases
span filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising, self-driving car, visual inspection


#Regression 
- predict a number, infinitely many possible outputs
- target variable is continuous $(3399, 3943.23, 39432)$

#Classification 
- predict categories, small number of possible output
-  target variable is a discret value $(1, 0)$ or even no-numeric ($cat, dog$)

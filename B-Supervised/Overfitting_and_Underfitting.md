# Overfitting and Underfitting
#Overfitting #Underfitting 

## Definition

Data
- Extreme examples (outliers) can increase overfitting
- #NorminalVariable examples can reduce overfitting

| Underfit                           | Just Right                       | Overfit                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Does not fit the training set well | Fits training set pretty well | Fits the training set extremely well |
| High bias                          | generalization                | high variance                        |
| There is a clear pattern shows that algorithm is unable to capture the data or with very strong preconception | Make good predictions with new data | End up with totally different predictions or highly variant predictions |

The temperature is just right to drink.

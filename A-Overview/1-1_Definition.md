## Definition
ML is about giving computers the ability to get better at some task by learning from data, instead of having to explicitly code rules.

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience.

T = flag spam fro new emails  
E = training data  
P = need to be defined, e.g., ratio of correctly classified emails

## To Solve 4 Types of Problems
- complex problems - no algorithmic solution
- replace long lists of hand-tuned rules
- build systems that adapt to fluctuating environments
- help humans learn (e.g., data mining).

# Is There a Path to Artificial General Intelligence AGI?
#AGI #ArtificialGeneralIntelligence

## AI
- 2 things
- **ANI - Artificial Narrow Intelligence** #ANI : smart speaker, self-driving car, web search, AI in farming and factories
- **AGI - Artificial General Intelligence** #AGI : Do anything a human can do  

## Why not AGI?
- ANN - too simple, compared to biological neuron
- We have (almost) no idea how the brain works

## One learning algorithm hypothesis
- maybe a lot of intelligence could be due to one or a small handful of learning algorithms
- if we could figure out what that one or small handful of algorithms are, we might be able to implement that in a computer
- many different parts of the brain just depending on what data it is given, can learn to see /feel/hear
- human brain is amazingly adaptable
- how to replicate the algorithm and implement in computer
